TITLE: Minny's Grill - Menu/Order - Vanilla JS

DESCRIPTION: This web app is a first for me, it had the 
capability to add, delete, clear all,check out window using 
HTTP Requests, and localStorage.
The app is build using Javascript, HTML5, CSS, Get & Post 
requests and HTTP Servers.

The biggest hurdles I had with this app was the Servers & 
localStorage. I had built the majority of my app by the time
I implemented localStorage, I had to back track quite a bit
as well as having to figure out obscure ways to implement
localStorage.

HOW TO USE: Using the project is simple, the user will head over
to the Pickup Menu, add an item + Special instruction to the cart, 
if needed the user can either delete a singular item or clear all
(which will also clear localStorage) Once done adding items to the
cart the user will checkout then be lead to a confirmation page,
with Name, Phone number and Pickup time.
